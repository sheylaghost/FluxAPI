FluX API is an open-source project designed to serve as a **flexible starting foundation for building APIs from scratch**, encouraging creativity, learning, and community collaboration.

This project is **not a finished API**. Instead, it exists to help developers create their own APIs freely, defining their own architecture, business rules, technologies, and identity.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Provide a solid starting point for API development  
- Encourage creativity and experimentation
